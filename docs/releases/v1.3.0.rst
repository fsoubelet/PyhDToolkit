1.3.0
-----

Release `1.3.0` brings a few additions and bug fixes.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.aperture.plot_physical_apertures` now has an ``xoffset`` argument similar to the one of the other plotting functions.
* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.envelope.plot_beam_envelope` now has an ``xoffset`` argument similar to the one of the other plotting functions.
* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.layout` module has a new public function, `scale_patches`, to enable easy scaling of the element patches.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.layout.plot_machine_layout` function will now plot skew elements too, with a hatching pattern to differentiate them from their normal counterparts.

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.styles.paper.SINGLE_COLUMN` matplotlib style has been adjusted to be tighter at the edges of the figure when saving to a file.
* Relaxed the tolerance of some coupling correction tests as the routine seems to perform slightly worse on the new MAD-X version.
* Removed deprecated workers versions from the CI configuration.
* Updated the CI configuration to use the latest versions of the docker actions.
