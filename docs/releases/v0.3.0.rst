Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``helpers`` module now has a ``Parameters`` class for beam and machine parameters calculations. Only one function yet.
* The ``plotters`` module now has a ``AperturePlotter`` class with a function to plot physical aperture.
* The ``latwiss`` module has received a major overhaul.

  - ``plot_latwiss`` has better defaults in values and plotting styles, as well as new args and kwargs options for customization.
  - ``plot_machine_survey`` also has better defaults, and offers the options to plot while differentiating magnetic elements.
