.. _release_0.13.0:

0.13.0
------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added a ``install_ac_dipole_as_matrix`` function in the ``cpymadtools.special`` module to install an AC Dipole element as a matrix, which will reflect its effect on twiss functions (which the kicker implementation does not). This matrix implementation cannot be used to influence particle tracking.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* The ``install_ac_dipole_as_kicker`` function now properly sets the element location to avoid a negative drift (location taken from omc3's model_creator) if the sequence wasn't previously made ``THIN`` (which it should).
* The ``install_ac_dipole_as_kicker`` function now makes a ``use, sequence=...`` call after installing the element. Beware this means errors, correctors etc. that were set / loaded will be lost.

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``install_ac_dipole`` function in ``cpymadtools.special`` is now named ``install_ac_dipole_as_kicker``. This kicker implementation **cannot** be used to affect twiss functions, only particle tracking.
