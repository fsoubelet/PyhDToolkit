1.2.0
-----

Release `1.2.0` brings some new features and dependency changes.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.utils` module has a new function, `~pyhdtoolkit.plotting.utils.draw_confidence_ellipse`, to plot the covariance ellipse of two arrays.
* An experimental utility function was added to split a complex-valued columns from a dataframe into two real-valued ones. It might join the public API in a future release, and is for now available as `~pyhdtoolkit.utils._misc.split_complex_columns`.
* An experimental utility function was added to add noise to the ``LHC`` *IR* BPMs in a given dataframe column. It might join the public API in a future release, and is for now available as `~pyhdtoolkit.utils._misc.add_noise_to_ir_bpms`.
* An experimental utility function was added to add noise to the ``LHC`` *arc* BPMs in a given dataframe column. It might join the public API in a future release, and is for now available as `~pyhdtoolkit.utils._misc.add_noise_to_arc_bpms`. 


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The documentation generated by `Sphinx` should now properly display short type hints instead of the full expanded ones.
* Some example pages have been updated to use the minimal requirement of provided **args** for the functions in `~pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools.matching`.
* Some typos that were left in a few docstrings have been corrected.

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `madx` argument is now positional only in all APIs involving it (APIs in `~pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools` and `~pyhdtoolkit.plotting`).
* The `~numpy` dependency is now capped at version `<1.24.0`, as when using this new version some `~matplotlib` functions are broken.
* Various type hints from the `typing` module, such as `Dict` or `List`, have been superseeded by the default, now-standard builtins (such as `dict` or `list`).
