1.6.0
-----

Release `1.6.0` brings a few changes, and a great amount of maintenance fixes to the package.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools.lhc.make_lhc_beams` function now accepts the user providing values for `npart` and `sige`. The previously hard-coded values are now used as defaults.

Changes
~~~~~~~

* The `pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools.lhc.make_lhc_beams` function now expects `nemitt_[xy]` arguments instead of the previous `emittance_[xy]`. Providing the previous name is still accepted but will raise a warning.

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* A great amount of linting has been done to ensure best practices in every line of code.
* Switched all relevant type hints to use the latest practices.
* Fixed the `__all__` exports in the `__init__.py` files.
* Moved type-hint relevant imports in a `TYPE_CHECKING` block to lighten import times.
