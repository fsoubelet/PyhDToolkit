0.19.0
------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting` package has a new sub-package, `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.sbs` with modules to plot coupling (`~pyhdtoolkit.plotting.sbs.coupling`) and phase (`~pyhdtoolkit.plotting.sbs.phase`) segment-by-segment results.
* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.sbs` package has a new utility module, `~pyhdtoolkit.plotting.sbs.utils`, with helpful functions for plotting.
* The `pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools.lhc` module has a new function, `~pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools.lhc.get_lhc_bpms_twiss_and_rdts` to easily get coupling RDTs at all observation points (BPMs) in the LHC sequence.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A new gallery was added showcasing the plotting of segment-by-segment coupling and phase results.

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `~pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools.plotters.LatticePlotter.plot_latwiss` function now plots the quadrupole gradient of a dipole with the same shade as a normal quadrupole.
* A new dependency, the `optics_functions` package, was added.
* The documentation for the `~pyhdtoolkit.maths.plotting` module has been extended.
* Tests were added for the new functionality.
* Input files for various tests have been regrouped in relevant directories for clarity.
