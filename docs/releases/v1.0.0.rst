1.0.0
-----

Release `1.0.0` brings many breaking changes.
Be sure to read these release notes carefully before upgrading, as much of the code using ``pyhdtoolki`` will need to be adapted.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* All plotting functionality has been regrouped into `~pyhdtoolkit.plotting`. The plotting classes previously found in `~pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools.plotters` have been turned each into a single module in `~pyhdtoolkit.plotting`.
* The `~pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools.plotters` module has been completely removed.
* The `~pyhdtoolkit.plotting.helpers` module has been renamed to `~pyhdtoolkit.plotting.utils` for consistency.

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Documentation has been updated. Refer to the gallery for example uses.
* Tests have been adapted.
