0.4.0
-----

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Optimization of the Docker image.
* Removal of the ``fsbox`` dependency.
* Use of ``loguru`` library for logging, and improved logging.
* Refactored commandline argument parsing for scripts.
* Improved type hinting.

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Renaming pyhdtoolkit.math to pyhdtoolkit.maths to avoid namespace clashes if trying to use the standard library's math module.
