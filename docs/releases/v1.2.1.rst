1.2.1
-----

Release `1.2.1` brings a few fixes.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.aperture.plot_physical_apertures` now has an ``xoffset`` argument similar to the one of the other plotting functions.
* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.envelope.plot_beam_envelope` now has an ``xoffset`` argument similar to the one of the other plotting functions.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.layout.plot_machine_layout` function will now plot skew elements too, with a hatching pattern to differentiate them from their normal counterparts.

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `pyhdtoolkit.plotting.styles.paper.SINGLE_COLUMN` matplotlib style has been adjusted to be tighter at the edges of the figure when saving to a file.
