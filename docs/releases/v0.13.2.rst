0.13.2
------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed the ``get_pattern_twiss function`` in ``cpymadtools.twiss``. Starting with ``cpymad`` 1.9.0, ``Table.selected_rows()`` now actually returns the indices of the selected elements rather than returning a boolean mask. The previous (faulty) behavior had been worked around in ``get_pattern_twiss``, which is now an issue. The correct ``Table.selected_rows()`` behavior is now used.

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The minimum ``cpymad`` required version is now 1.9.0.
