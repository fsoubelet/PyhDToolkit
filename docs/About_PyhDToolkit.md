# About PyhDToolkit

## Purpose

This package is an all-in-one collection of baseline utilities I use in my PhD work.
Most of the codes here have their use in my day-to-day work, but not necessarily in our team's softwares.

## Functionality

For now, `PyhDToolkit` provides some of the following features:

- A `cpymadtools` module with tools building on [`cpymad`][cpymad], a Python bindings library for the [`MAD-X`][madx] code; including generators, matching routines, plotting utilities etc.
- A `maths` module for useful methods used in analysis.
- An `optics` module for particle accelerator physics related calculations and analysis.
- A `plotting` module for various `matplotlib` helpers.
- A `utils` module for various Python and UNIX utilities.
