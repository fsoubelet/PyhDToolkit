Command Line Scripts
====================

We provide a set of small command line utilities within `PyhDToolkit`.
Please note that scripts might require optional dependencies to be installed.

Each script is registered in the project's metadata and will be callable from the command line with a simplified name after installing the package in your environment.
For more information on each script such as required extras, registered name, options and examples, please refer to their dedicated documentation page.
The following scripts are currently available:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :glob:

    script/*
