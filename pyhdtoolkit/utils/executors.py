A module providing two classes to execute functions + arguments couples through either a multiprocessing approach,
or a multithreading approach.

Here are a few tidbits to keep in mind:
- There can only be one thread running at any given time in a python process. The GIL makes sure of that.
- Multiprocessing is parallelism. Multithreading is concurrency.
- Multiprocessing is for increasing speed. Multithreading is for hiding latency.
- Multiprocessing is best for computations. Multithreading is best for IO.
- If you have CPU heavy tasks, use multiprocessing with n_process = n_cores and never more. Never.
- If you have IO heavy tasks, use multithreading with n_threads = m * n_cores with m a number bigger than 1 that you
can tweak on your own. Try many values and choose the one with the best speedup because there isnâ€™t a general rule.
For instance the default value of m in ThreadPoolExecutor is set to 5 I think is quite random.
