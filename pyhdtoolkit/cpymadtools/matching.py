    .. versionadded:: 0.8.0

    Provided with an active `~cpymad.madx.Madx` object, will run relevant commands to match tunes
    and/or chromaticities. As target values are given, the function expects knob names to be provided,
    which are then used and varied by ``MAD-X`` to match the targets. This is a convenient wrapper around
    the ``MATCH`` command. For usage details, see the
    `MAD-X manual <http://madx.web.cern.ch/madx/releases/last-rel/madxuguide.pdf>`_.

    One can find example use of this function in the :ref:`lattice plotting <demo-accelerator-lattice>`,
    :ref:`rigid waist shift <demo-rigid-waist-shift>` or :ref:`phase space <demo-phase-space>` example
    galleries.

    .. important::
        If target tune values only are provided, then tune matching is performed with the provided knobs.
        If target chromaticity values only are provided, then chromaticity matching is performed with the
        provided knobs. If targets for both types are provided, then both are matched in a single call with
        the provided knobs.

    .. note::
        If the user wishes to perform different matching calls for each, then it is recommended to call this
        function as many times as necessary, with the appropriate targets.

        For instance, in some cases and machines some prefer to do a tune matching followed by a chromaticity matching,
        then followed by a combined matching. In this case the function should be called three times, once with tune
        targets and knobs, another time with chromaticity targets and knobs, then a final time with all of the above.
        For this, simple wrappers are provided: the :func:`match_tunes` and :func:`match_chromaticities` functions.

    .. hint::
        When acting of either the ``LHC`` or ``HLLHC`` machines, the accelerator name can be provided and the vary
        knobs will be automatically set accordingly to the provided targets. Note that only the relevant knobs are
        set, so if tune targets only are provided, then tune knobs only will be used, and not chromaticity knobs.
        If explicit knobs are provided, these will always be used. On other machines the knobs should be provided
        explicitly, always.

    .. important::
        The matching is always performed with the ``CHROM`` option on.

    Args:
        madx (cpymad.madx.Madx): an instanciated `~cpymad.madx.Madx` object.
        accelerator (Optional[str]): name of the accelerator, used to determmine knobs if *variables* is not given.
            Automatic determination will only work for ``LHC`` and ``HLLHC``.
        sequence (str): name of the sequence you want to perform the matching for.
        q1_target (float): horizontal tune to match to.
        q2_target (float): vertical tune to match to.
        dq1_target (float): horizontal chromaticity to match to.
        dq2_target (float): vertical chromaticity to match to.
        varied_knobs (Sequence[str]): the variables names to ``VARY`` in the ``MAD-X`` ``MATCH`` routine. An input
            could be ``["kqf", "ksd", "kqf", "kqd"]`` as they are common names used for quadrupole and sextupole
            strengths (focusing / defocusing) in most examples.
        telescopic_squeeze (bool): ``LHC`` specific. If set to `True`, uses the ``(HL)LHC`` knobs for Telescopic
            Squeeze configuration. Defaults to `True` since `v0.9.0`.
        run3 (bool): if set to `True`, uses the ``LHC`` Run 3 `*_op` knobs. Defaults to `False`.
        step (float): step size to use when varying knobs.
        calls (int): max number of varying calls to perform. Defaults to 100.
        tolerance (float): tolerance for successfull matching. Defaults to :math:`10^{-21}`.
