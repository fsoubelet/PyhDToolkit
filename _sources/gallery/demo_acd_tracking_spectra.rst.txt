==================================
AC Dipole Driven Tracking Spectrum
==================================

This example shows how to use the `~.lhc.install_ac_dipole_as_kicker` and
`~.track.track_single_particle` function to track a  particle with the
``TRACK`` command of ``MAD-X``, and visualise its coordinates and spectrum.

In this example we will use the LHC lattice to illustrate the ACD tracking
workflow when using `~pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools`.

.. note::
    This is very similar to the :ref:`free tracking example <demo-free-tracking>`
    with the difference that there is special care to take to install the AC Dipole
    element. It is recommended to read that tutorial first as this one will focus
    on the specificities of the AC Dipole setup.

.. important::
    This example requires the `acc-models-lhc` repository to be cloned locally. One
    can get it by running the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone -b 2022 https://gitlab.cern.ch/acc-models/acc-models-lhc.git --depth 1

    Here I set the 2022 branch for stability and reproducibility of the documentation
    builds, but you can use any branch you want.

Let's start by setting up the LHC in ``MAD-X``, in this case at top energy.
To understand the function below have a look at the :ref:`lhc setup example
<demo-lhc-setup>`.

Slicing is necessary in ``MAD-X`` in order to perform tracking, so let's do so.
We could have asked for the slicing directly in the `~.lhc.prepare_lhc_run3`
function call too!

Before tracking, we need to install the AC dipole element. We need to specify
the driven tunes, the kick amplitude, and the ramp-up, flat-top and ramp-down
turns. Note that in a real machine, the ramping process should respect some
constaints to stay adiabatic with regards to the emittance (:cite:t:`Tomas:ACDAdiabaticity:2005`)

.. important::
    In a real machine, the AC Dipole does impact the orbit as well as the betatron
    functions when turned on (:cite:t:`Miyamoto:ACD:2008`, part III). In ``MAD-X``
    however, it cannot be modeled to do both at the same time. This routine introduces
    an AC Dipole as a kicker element so that its effect can be seen on particle trajectory
    in tracking. It **does not** affect ``TWISS`` functions.

Here we will choose for the settings the same values as we use in operation in the LHC:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-92

.. code-block:: Python


    lhc.install_ac_dipole_as_kicker(
        madx,
        deltaqx=-0.01,  # driven horizontal tune to Qxd = 62.31 - 0.01 = 62.30
        deltaqy=0.012,  # driven vertical tune to Qyd = 60.32 + 0.012 = 60.332
        sigma_x=2,  # bunch amplitude kick in the horizontal plane
        sigma_y=2,  # bunch amplitude kick in the vertical plane
        beam=1,  # beam for which to install and kick
        start_turn=100,  # when to turn on the AC Dipole
        ramp_turns=2000,  # how many turns to ramp up/down the AC Dipole
        top_turns=6600,  # how many turns to keep the AC Dipole at full kick
    )

Now we can track a particle. The process is fully similar to what was described
in the :ref:`free tracking example <demo-free-tracking>`.

.. code-block:: Python


    tracks_dict = track.track_single_particle(
        madx,
        nturns=10_800,  # give at least (start + ramp + flat-top + ramp + margin)
        initial_coordinates=(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
        observation_points=["BPM.15L2.B1"],
    )

Let's have a look at the trajectory of the particle at the **BPM.15L2.B1**
element through the turns, here in the horizontal plane:

    tracks = tracks_dict["observation_point_2"]  # this is BPM.15L2.B1

    )
    plt.show()

We can see the AC Dipole did its job: the amplitude of the particle stays
at 0 for the first 100 turns, then ramps up for 2000 turns, stays at full
kick strength for 6600 turns, then ramps down during another 2000 turns.

In order to plot the spectra of the particle motion, let's first determine it.
Take in consideration that here, we are interested in the driven motion, so
we need to compute the ``np.fft.fft`` on a subset of the tracking data. In our
case, the flat-top starts at turn :math:`100 + 2000 = 2100`, and ends at turn
:math:`100 + 2000 + 6600 = 8700`.

    spectrum["horizontal"] = np.abs(np.fft.fft(tracks.x.to_numpy()[2100:8700]))  # top turns
    spectrum["vertical"] = np.abs(np.fft.fft(tracks.y.to_numpy()[2100:8700]))  # top turns
    spectrum["tunes"] = np.linspace(0, 1, len(spectrum))
    spectrum = spectrum[spectrum.tunes.between(0, 0.5)]  # do not care about other half

.. tip::
    To get the tunes of the particle, one can find the peak of the spectra. Below
    is how we get the fractional part of the tunes. One can check that those values
    are indeed the desired driven fractional tunes (0.30, 0.332):

    .. code-block:: python

     qxd = spectrum.tunes[spectrum.horizontal == spectrum.horizontal.max()].to_numpy()[0]
     qyd = spectrum.tunes[spectrum.vertical == spectrum.vertical.max()].to_numpy()[0]

One can now plot the spectra, and here we will add two stem lines at the position of the
determined driven tunes to highlight them.

    qxd = spectrum.tunes[spectrum.horizontal == spectrum.horizontal.max()].to_numpy()[0]
    qyd = spectrum.tunes[spectrum.vertical == spectrum.vertical.max()].to_numpy()[0]

    spectrum.plot(
        x="tunes",
        y=["horizontal", "vertical"],
        figsize=(18, 10),
        xlim=(0.28, 0.38),
        title="Driven Motion Spectrum",
        xlabel="Tunes",
        ylabel="Spectrum [a.u]",
        logy=True,
    )
    plt.stem(qxd, spectrum.horizontal.max(), linefmt="C0--", markerfmt="C0o", label=r"$Q_{xD}$")
    plt.stem(qyd, spectrum.vertical.max(), linefmt="C1--", markerfmt="C1o", label=r"$Q_{yD}$")
