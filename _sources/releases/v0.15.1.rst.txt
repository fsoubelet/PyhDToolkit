Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* The ``misalign_lhc_ir_quadrupoles`` function in the ``cpymadtools.errors`` module can now properly handle several IPs at the same time. Its *ip* parameter has been renamed to *ips* and properly expects a sequence.

See `v0.15.1 release notes on GitHub <https://github.com/fsoubelet/PyhDToolkit/releases/tag/0.15.1>`_ and the `full changes since v0.15.0 <https://github.com/fsoubelet/PyhDToolkit/compare/0.15.0...0.15.1>`_.
