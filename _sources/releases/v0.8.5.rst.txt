0.8.5
-----

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* The ``match_tunes_and_chromaticities`` function now properly behaves if some targets are set to 0.

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The default behavior in lattice slicing is changed to have makedipedge as False, which compensates the effect of the default slicing style ``TEAPOT``.
