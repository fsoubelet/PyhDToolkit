1.1.1
-----

Release `1.1.1` brings a few fixes and settings changes.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Various functions in the `~pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools` submodules do not use the ``CHROM`` flag by default (in ``TWISS`` or matching routines). Providing ``CHROM`` is still possible through ``kwargs``.
* Many calls to `.copy()` following a call to `.dframe()` when querying a ``MAD-X`` table have been removed, as they were redundant.
* A few values in the available plotting settings were changed.
